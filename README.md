# Scrollbar Remover Extension
Repository for my Scrollbar Remover Extension ( Chrome / Chromium )

This little extension ( script ) was created by me to remove the ugly scrollbar from the side of the Chrome/Chromium Browser. This extension only hides de scrollbar, you will still be able to do everything else.

## How to Install 

- First Download the extension clicking here => (https://github.com/lnardon/scrollbarExtension/archive/master.zip)
- Unzip the pack and go to your chrome extensions tab
- Enable Developer Mode on the page
- Click on the "Load Unpacked" Button and choose the folder of the extension
